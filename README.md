I'm learning about Plex and Pyacc, which are Object Pascal implementations of Lex and Yacc

I'm working through the O'Reilly book ['Lex & Yacc' (2nd edition)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565920002.do) and as I go I'm translating the examples from lex/yacc/c to plex/pyacc/fpc

There are a few pages on the [Lazarus wiki](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Plex_and_Pyacc)
 but they're woefully inadequate
 
 I've started a [Wiki here](https://github.com/MFernstrom/plex-and-pyacc-examples/wiki) while I'm going and when ready I'll write up proper documentation on the Lazarus wiki.
