I'm learning about Plex and Pyacc, which are Object Pascal implementations of Lex and Yacc

I'm working through the O'Reilly book 'Lex & Yacc' (2nd edition) and as I go I'll try translating the examples from lex/yacc/c to plex/pyacc/fpc

There's a few pages on the Lazarus wiki but they're woefully inadequate https://wiki.freepascal.org/Plex_and_Pyacc
