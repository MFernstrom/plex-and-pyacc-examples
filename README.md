I'm learning about Plex and Pyacc, which are Object Pascal implementations of Lex and Yacc

I'm working through the O'Reilly book ['Lex & Yacc' (2nd edition)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565920002.do) and as I go I'll try translating the examples from lex/yacc/c to plex/pyacc/fpc

There's a few pages on the [Lazarus wiki](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Plex_and_Pyacc)
 but they're woefully inadequate
